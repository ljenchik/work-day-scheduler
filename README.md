# Work Day Scheduler

## The application is live at https://ljenchik.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

## Description

I created  a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of one day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner as well as color-coded timeblocks for standard business hours. Color-code for each each timeblock is based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed. A user is able to to enter an event when they click a timeblock and save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
